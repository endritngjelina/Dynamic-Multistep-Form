Dynamic‑Multistep‑Form

A lightweight, dependency‑free multi‑step form built with HTML + CSS + JavaScript. The repository includes several versions so you can see different approaches and refine the UX over time.

✨ Highlights

Pure front‑end: no frameworks, no build step — just open an HTML file.

Modular steps: each step lives in simple, readable markup.

Client‑side checks: set up for basic validations (required fields, patterns, etc.).

Keyboard friendly: intended to work well with Tab/Shift‑Tab and Enter.

Easy to customize: tweak styles and step order without touching a big codebase.

Depending on the version you open, the UI and behavior may vary slightly as the project evolves.

🚀 Getting Started

Clone or download this repository.

Open one of the HTML files directly in your browser:

dynamic multistep form 0.html

dynamic multistep form 1.html

dynamic multistep form 2.html

That’s it. No build tools or servers required.

📁 Project Structure

.
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── dynamic multistep form 0.html   # early iteration (baseline)
├── dynamic multistep form 1.html   # iterative improvements
└── dynamic multistep form 2.html   # latest iteration / polish

Each file is a stand‑alone demo. They may differ in visual styling, validation flow, or micro‑interactions. Open and compare.

🧭 Using the Form

Use Next / Back controls (or keyboard) to navigate between steps.

Required fields are marked in the UI; browsers handle many checks natively.

On the final step, review inputs and click Submit.

If you’re adapting this for production, wire the submit handler to your API or add a real <form action="..." method="post"> target.

🎨 Customization

Steps: Add/remove step containers in the HTML and update the navigation JS selectors.

Styling: Edit the CSS block (or a separate stylesheet) to change spacing, colors, and transitions.

Validation: Use HTML attributes like required, pattern, and minlength, and extend the JS to show friendly messages.

♿ Accessibility Checklist

All interactive elements are reachable via keyboard.

Labels are associated to inputs via for / id.

Use aria-current="step" or visually clear indicators for the active step, if provided.

Ensure focus moves meaningfully when steps change.

(Feel free to open an issue if you spot an a11y improvement!)

🌐 Browser Support

Built with modern, standards‑based HTML/CSS/JS. Works in the latest versions of major browsers. Graceful degradation depends on which version you run and the CSS features used.
